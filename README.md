Different assignments given throughout the course

## 🔬 Assignments
Throughout the semester we had different Home/Class assignments. The assignments are meant to deepen our understanding of DNN, not necessarily focusing on the coding aspect.


| Count | Assignment | Solution | Topic | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
